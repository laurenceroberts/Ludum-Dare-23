h1. Ludum Dare 23 - Un-named Project

This is my entry to Ludum Dare 23 [http://www.ludumdare.com]

The theme is 'Tiny World'

h2. Concepts

h3. Tiny World

You play as a collector of tiny worlds, several tiny worlds exist within your
world, and your world is a tiny world existing within another world. In a
sort of Gulliver's Travels esque way.

You hoover up the worlds and their inhabitants

h3. Paint your own platforms

The main gameplay concept is that your character must paint the platforms they
run on. The paint gradually 'drips' and the platform is lost.

The player also slowly slides down the platform forcing them to keep moving.

h3. Enemies

* 'Turpentine' blob - erases paint player has shot
